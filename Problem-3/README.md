# Week 3 Assignment 3

Given a set of values, the mean is defined as their sum divided by the number of values. In the following assignment you are given a list of weights and you'll compute the mean value.

TASK: Use a loop to compute the mean weight from the list of weights reported in the file (there are faster ways - for now let's use a for loop). Print the result with 1 decimal digit.   

EXPECTED OUTCOME: 87.5 kg
